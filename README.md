**App.elm structure:**

*Model*

* we define a type alias w/ a plain String


*Init function*


The `init` function receives a tuple where
* the first argument is the initial state
* the second one is the initial command to run

*Messages*


We are not sending any messages to our app so far that's why we have `NoOp`


# How to run it:

Just run elm's reactor on the main directory

```
 elm reactor
```
